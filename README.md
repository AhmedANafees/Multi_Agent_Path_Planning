# Multi-Agent Path Planning

This repository contains the source code for a term project on path planning in dynamic, multi-agent environments.

It explores the implementation and comparison of several search algorithms:
- **Greedy Best-First Search (BFS)**
- **A***
- **Weighted A***
- **Simplified Memory-Bounded A\* (SMA\*)**

Multiple heuristic strategies are applied to evaluate their efficiency.

The simulation features:
- Real-time agent communication under **partial observability**
- Performance benchmarking against paths generated by **Gemini's API**
