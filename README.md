# Multi_Agent_Path_Planning
A simulation for multi-agent path planning in Python. This project implements and analyzes A*, Greedy BFS, and other search algorithms with various heuristics. Robots communicate in real-time to navigate a grid, with solutions benchmarked against the Gemini API for path optimality and performance.
