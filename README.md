# Multi_Agent_Path_Planning
This repository contains the source code for a term project on path planning in dynamic, multi-agent environments. It explores the implementation and comparison of various search algorithms (A*, Greedy BFS, Weighted A*, SMA*) with multiple heuristic strategies. The simulation features real-time agent communication under partial observability and benchmarks the results against paths generated by the Gemini API.
